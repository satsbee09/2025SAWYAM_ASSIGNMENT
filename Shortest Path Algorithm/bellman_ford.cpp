/*
Logic:
- Iteratively "relaxes" all edges V - 1 times.
- Handles negative weights, can detect negative cycles.
Time Complexity: O(VE)

Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize distances (0 for source, infinity for others).
2. Repeat V-1 times: for each edge, update its endpoint's distance if a shorter path is found.
3. After V-1 relaxations, check all edges again; if further improvement, negative cycle exists.

Bellman-Ford finds single-source shortest paths in a weighted directed graph and can 
handle negative weights. It is slower than Dijkstra (O(VE)), but crucial for graphs 
with negative edges. Also, it detects negative cycles — if found, shortest paths 
aren't well-defined.
